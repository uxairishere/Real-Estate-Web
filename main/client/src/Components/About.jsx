                <p className="privacy-p">It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use SocialDeb want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.</p>
                <p className="privacy-p">With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use SocialDeb by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared. </p>
